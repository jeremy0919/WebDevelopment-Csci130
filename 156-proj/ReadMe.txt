My initial attempt at socket programming for tic tac toe

Project outcome
- The tic tac toe javascript functions as intended for both single player and multiplayer
- I started to implement database functionality and extra features before realizing I was exceding project scope and needed to focus on socket programming
- scrapped project and restarted in python
