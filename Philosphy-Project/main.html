        <p>
            Testing social cognition of dolphins and how well they adapt to their environment<br>
            <strong>Testing Variables:</strong>time it takes to achieve outcome<br>
            <strong>Changing Variables:</strong> Location of instruction/ end goal<br>
            <strong>Constant Variables:</strong> reward<br>

        <h1>Interpretation of results Social Cognition</h1>
        <p>
            Dolphins quickly adapted to their environemnt, not only able to react to different instructions but also realized that if both dolphins worked together they could achieve the goal the easiest. Started adaapting faster and faster together to changing instructions. <br>

        <h1>MIRROR TEST</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Environment:</strong> Dolphins were put in a familiar enviornment with a mirror placed in front of them<br>
            <strong>Observation:</strong> Dolphins weren't afraid or treat mirror like another animal instead made movements and viewed reflection, then looked at areas of their body they werent able to see<br>
            <strong>Take away:</strong> Dolphins are highly intelligent and able to quickly grasp changes to their environment such as a mirror being a reflection instead of another dolphin<br>
