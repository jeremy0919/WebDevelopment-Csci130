    Only the dark squares of the checkerboard are used. A piece can only move diagonally into an
unoccupied square. When capturing an opponent's piece is possible, capturing is mandatory in most
official rules. If the player does not capture, the other player can remove the opponent's piece as a
penalty (or muffin), and where there are two or more such positions the player forfeits pieces that
cannot be moved (although some rule variations make capturing optional). In almost all variants, the
player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.
