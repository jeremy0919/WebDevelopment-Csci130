<!-- With the tag style, it it possible to include information related to the presentation of the different elements 
You can think of the definition of each HTML tag as a static class where you set parameters to the properties of the tag.
By default (if you dont associate any information), it will be displayed with a black font, with a basic formating structure.
You can check what was the default presentation with the previous examples that were given.

<style>
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
}

p {
    font-family: verdana;
    font-size: 20px;
}
</style>


<!-- This part of the HTML code is basic HTML code, as you can notice it doesnt include anything special -->
