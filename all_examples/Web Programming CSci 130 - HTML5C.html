<!-- it changes nothing for the text but if a program parse the webpage it can easily extract information about the page 
also see datetime and pubdate -->
I have done this web page on <time>8/24/2017</time>.

<br>It is another date:
<time datetime="2017-8-12" pubdate="pubdate">October 15, 2017</time><p></p>

<!-- b and i for bold and italic are for previous versions of HTML -->
<p> I m starting a new paragraph and this text is <strong>important</strong> while I just want to emphasize this <em>element</em>.
I can also include some references or citations such as <cite lang="fr">Une citation en francais</cite>. It stays in italic with the default formating but the semantic is different. 
A quote can be done with the tag q: <q>I am quoting myself</q>. As you can see it adds automatically the quotation marks.
Be careful dont use the quote semantic if you just want the quotation marks!!
I can highlight the text like <mark>this</mark>.
<br>
It is also useful to explain acronyms like <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr>, 
<abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr>, and <abbr title="California State University Fresno">CSUF</abbr>.
<br>
You can define a term with dfn such as <dfn>smurf</dfn>.
<br>
It is a <sub>subscript</sub> while it is a <sup>supscript</sup>.
<br>
You can delete some text with del like this <del>this text has been deleted</del>. It is useful for dynamic documents.
<br>
<ins>You can do this too</ins>
<br>
Now if you want to put html tags in the text, it is more complicated &lt;p&gt; it is not an HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;.
