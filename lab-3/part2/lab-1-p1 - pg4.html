        <p>In the early 2000s, platforms like Friendster, MySpace, and later Facebook pioneered the concept of connecting with friends and sharing updates online. These platforms laid the foundation for the social media revolution, enabling users to create profiles, share photos, and communicate with their network. As the years went on, new platforms emerged, each with a unique focus ï¿½ Twitter for microblogging, Instagram for visual sharing, and LinkedIn for professional networking.   </p>

            The rise of smartphones further accelerated the adoption of social media. With easy access to these platforms through mobile apps, people could connect and engage in real time from anywhere. This marked a turning point in how news spread, as events could be documented and shared by individuals on the ground, challenging traditional media's monopoly on information dissemination.

            Social media's impact on society extends beyond personal connections. It has become a powerful tool for activism, sparking movements like the Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter. Additionally, it has reshaped marketing and branding strategies, with influencers and businesses leveraging platforms to reach massive audiences directly. However, this influence isn't without its downsides, as the spread of misinformation and the erosion of privacy have become critical issues.
